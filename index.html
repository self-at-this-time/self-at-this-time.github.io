     I was born. I stayed alive, existed in this existence, no change in who what I was, I just was..until 17.
     All I wanted to do was to <q>do the right thing</q>, something to get attached to, become complete, 
     again staying alive, existing in this existence, no change in who what I was.
    </p>     
    <p>
     <strong>Logical action: the only thing I get attached to: no break- continuous- infinitesimal- infinity: human complete.</strong>
     <br>self definition: logical actor: sentient logical actor.<br>
     
     in other words:<br>
     <q>always do the right thing</q>.<br>
     always do: doer, actor.<br>
     the right thing: logical.<br>
     self definition: sentient logical doer: sentient rational agent: sentient logical actor.<br>
     
     
     <strong>human complete: sentient logical actor.</strong><br>
     who what I am, regardless of the environment, existence I'm in.
     </p>
     
     <p>
     human complete meaning:<br>
     act, do logically whether it causes self "infinite suffering, infinite joy, nonexistence, change in who what I am":<br>
     bigger than suffering, joy, existence, myself.
