     I was born. I stayed alive, existed in this existence, no change in who what I was, I just was..until 17.<br>
     All I wanted to do was to <q>do the right thing</q>, something to get attached to, become complete, 
     again I stayed alive, existed in this existence, no change in who what I was.<br>
     
     <p>
     <strong>Logical action: the only thing I get attached to: no break- continuous- infinitesimal- infinity: human complete.</strong>
